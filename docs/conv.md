Stuff I'm happy to talk about approximately always and wherever. Roughly descending order according to my interest (but only roughly and my relative interest fluctuates, probably especially for the less-subjectively-interesting things).

- Alignment, agent foundations.
- Math and logic, in particular:
  - Category theory.
  - Non-classical logics.
- Philosophy, in particular:
  - Metaethics, metacognition, metamathematics; epistemology.
  - Philosophy of mathematics, (evolutionary) biology, science.
- History, in particular:
  - Alternative history, pivotal historical events (e.g. [Siege of Jerusalem 701 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_siege_of_Jerusalem)).
  - Pre-Columbian America.
  - Interesting/inspiring historical characters (e.g. [TR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt), [IkkyÅ«](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikky%C5%AB)).
- Rationality. Fixing and optimizing life. Practical wisdom.
- Languages (dead and living, formal and informal, natural and artificial).
- Psychonautics.
  - Classical psychedelics (esp. DMT).
  - Some other drugs: Salvia, Kratom.
- Whatever you find in my [favorite stuff page](/fav), especially fiction (or whatever adjacent stuff you know about that I may or may not know about).
