I am Mateusz Bagi≈Ñski. I go by `MatthewBaggins` in most online places. This is my very WIP website. More stuff will be added to it over the next few weeks/months/years. For now, here is my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/matthewbaggins).

My purpose is to push the world as much as possible in the direction of the good future, primarily by doing stuff that has a good chance of:

- averting AI X-risks
- ensuring positive effects of AI
- improving rationality/[coordination ability]/sanity of Humanity/Civilization

My current primary focus is an agent-foundations-theoretic investigation of the core drivers of goal-directed mental activity. The purpose is to find some foundational threads that will lead us to an understanding sufficient to <<"align AGI">> or at least put reasonable bounds on what may come out of weakly superhuman AI systems.

Other interests:

- High actuation spaces
- [Formal methods for alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) (e.g. [Davidad's Open Agency Architecture](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jRf4WENQnhssCb6mJ/davidad-s-bold-plan-for-alignment-an-in-depth-explanation)/[Safeguarded AI](https://www.aria.org.uk/programme-safeguarded-ai/))
- [Developmental interpretability/Singular Learning Theory](https://timaeus.co/)
- [Naturalized induction](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/naturalized-induction) (e.g. [Logical Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543), [Infra-Bayesianism](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/CmrW8fCmSLK7E25sa))
- Philosophy of probability
- Category theory
- Evolutionary biology (and [evolution/natural selection] more broadly than biology)
- Complex systems

If you want to talk to me, send me an email. I'm in Belgrade until mid-June, after which I will probably spend 3 months in London. What happens next is as-of-today-TBD.
