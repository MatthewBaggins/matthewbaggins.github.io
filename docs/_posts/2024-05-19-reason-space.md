It seems/feels that when humans do something like explicit/symbolic-ish reasoning, they are trying to navigate some "space" where certain "moves" are valid/allowed/justified whereas others are not.

Assume for a moment that the following premise is true.

> Reasoning can be fruitfully conceptualized in terms of moving within a reason-space and that space *has some (non-trivial) structure*.

**What is this structure?**

A most naive interpretation would probably some version of platonism. There is some abstract realm of all possibilities and our universe is a mere shadow of some of them. [Tegmark's mathematical universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Mathematical_Universe#Summary) goes even further than that, claiming that all mathematical structure that exists instantiates a "universe" (for an extremely broad notion of "universe").

I recently stumbled upon the thoughts of [Wilfrid Sellars](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/#ScieReal) who conceived of abstract entities as (as far as I understand it) metalinguistic descriptions of the appropriate/valid/well-tested rules of thought and the various laws of nature (and maybe even more broadly, valid mathematical/logical inferences) as "inference tickets".

I am in the process of trying to deconfuse myself about the structure and nature of reason-space, so this page will likely remain quite dynamic over the next few weeks/months.
